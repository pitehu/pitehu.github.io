There is a discrepancy between existing annotation guidelines of event causality and conventional causality corpora that focus more on linguistics. Many guidelines restrict themselves to include only explicit relations or clause-based arguments. Therefore, we propose an annotation schema for event causality that addresses these concerns. We annotated 3,559 event sentences from protest event news with labels on whether it contains causal relations or not. Our corpus is known as the Causal News Corpus (CNC). A neural network built upon a state-of-the-art pre-trained language model performed well with 81.20\\% F1 score on test set, and 83.46\\% in 5-folds cross-validation. CNC is transferable across two external corpora: CausalTimeBank (CTB) and Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB). Leveraging each of these external datasets for training, we achieved up to approximately 64\\% F1 on the CNC test set without additional fine-tuning. CNC also served as an effective training and pre-training dataset for the two external corpora. Lastly, we demonstrate the difficulty of our task to the layman in a crowd-sourced annotation exercise. Our annotated corpus is publicly available, providing a valuable resource for causal text mining researchers.","tags":[],"title":"The Causal News Corpus: Annotating Causal Relations in Event Sentences from News","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mian Zhong","Tiancheng Hu","Ying Jiao","Shehzaad Zuzar Dhuliawala","Bipin Singh"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1638835200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635678342,"objectID":"3085da04ab82199457b7f7750f77a04d","permalink":"https://pitehu.github.io/publication/hu_2021_repurposing/","publishdate":"2021-10-31T11:05:40.815452Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hu_2021_repurposing/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Drug Re-positioning via Text Augmented Knowledge Graph Embeddings","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Salvatore Giorgi","Vanni Zavarella","Hristo Tanev","Nicolas Stefanovitch","Sy Hwang","Hansi Hettiarachchi","Tharindu Ranasinghe","Vivek Kalyan","Paul Tan","Shaun Tan","Martin Andrews","Tiancheng Hu","Niklas Stoehr","Francesco Ignazio Re","Daniel Vegh","Dennis Atzenhofer","Brenda Curtis","Ali Hürriyetoğlu"],"categories":["Information Extraction"],"content":"","date":1627776000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635678342,"objectID":"5b4fcf8a519bdf1de82dca096ebf1fcd","permalink":"https://pitehu.github.io/publication/giorgi-etal-2021-discovering/","publishdate":"2021-10-31T11:05:40.815452Z","relpermalink":"/publication/giorgi-etal-2021-discovering/","section":"publication","summary":"Evaluating the state-of-the-art event detection systems on determining spatio-temporal distribution of the events on the ground is performed unfrequently. But, the ability to both (1) extract events ``in the wild″ from text and (2) properly evaluate event detection systems has potential to support a wide variety of tasks such as monitoring the activity of socio-political movements, examining media coverage and public support of these movements, and informing policy decisions. Therefore, we study performance of the best event detection systems on detecting Black Lives Matter (BLM) events from tweets and news articles. The murder of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, at the hands of police officers received global attention throughout the second half of 2020. Protests against police violence emerged worldwide and the BLM movement, which was once mostly regulated to the United States, was now seeing activity globally. This shared task asks participants to identify BLM related events from large unstructured data sources, using systems pretrained to extract socio-political events from text. We evaluate several metrics, accessing each system′s ability to identify protest events both temporally and spatially. Results show that identifying daily protest counts is an easier task than classifying spatial and temporal protest trends simultaneously, with maximum performance of 0.745 and 0.210 (Pearson $r$), respectively. Additionally, all baselines and participant systems suffered from low recall, with a maximum recall of 5.08.","tags":["Information Extraction"],"title":"Discovering Black Lives Matter Events in the United States: Shared Task 3, CASE 2021","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tiancheng Hu","Niklas Stoehr"],"categories":["Information Extraction"],"content":"","date":1627776000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635678340,"objectID":"2a490ac68322a162386d8597d70fa14b","permalink":"https://pitehu.github.io/publication/hu-stoehr-2021-team/","publishdate":"2021-10-31T11:05:39.494205Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hu-stoehr-2021-team/","section":"publication","summary":"An ever-increasing amount of text, in the form of social media posts and news articles, gives rise to new challenges and opportunities for the automatic extraction of socio-political events.

In the automotive context, head pose provides crucial information about the driver's mental state, including drowsiness, distraction and attention. It can also be used for interaction with in-vehicle infotainment systems. While computer vision algorithms using RGB cameras are reliable in controlled environments, head pose estimation is a challenging problem in the car due to sudden illumination changes, occlusions and large head rotations that are common in a vehicle. These issues can be partially alleviated by using depth cameras. Head rotation trajectories are continuous with important temporal dependencies. Our study leverages this observation, proposing a novel temporal deep learning model for head pose estimation from point cloud. The approach extracts discriminative feature representation directly from point cloud data, leveraging the 3D spatial structure of the face. The frame-based representations are then combined with bidirectional long short term memory (BLSTM) layers. We train this model on the newly collected multimodal driver monitoring (MDM) dataset, achieving better results compared to non-temporal algorithms using point cloud data, and state-of-the-art models using RGB images. We further show quantitatively and qualitatively that incorporating temporal information provides large improvements not only in accuracy, but also in the smoothness of the predictions.","tags":["Driver Visual Attention Modeling"],"title":"Temporal Head Pose Estimation From Point Cloud in Naturalistic Driving Conditions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sumit Jha","Mohamed F.

Recent advancements in deep learning and computer vision have shown great promise in monitoring human behavior and activities. While these algorithms work well in a controlled environment, naturalistic driving conditions add new challenges such as illumination variations, occlusions, and extreme head poses. A vast amount of in-domain data is required to train models that provide high performance in predicting driving related tasks to effectively monitor driver actions and behaviors. Toward building the required infrastructure, this paper presents the multimodal driver monitoring (MDM) dataset, which was collected with 59 subjects that were recorded performing various tasks. We use the Fi-Cap device that continuously tracks the head movement of the driver using fiducial markers, providing frame-based annotations to train head pose algorithms in naturalistic driving conditions. We ask the driver to look at predetermined gaze locations to obtain accurate correlation between the driver's facial image and visual attention. We also collect data when the driver performs common secondary activities such as navigation using a smart phone and operating the in-car infotainment system. All of the driver's activities are recorded with high definition RGB cameras and a time-of-flight depth camera. We also record the controller area network-bus (CAN-Bus), extracting important information. These high quality recordings serve as the ideal resource to train various efficient algorithms for monitoring the driver, providing further advancements in the field of in-vehicle safety systems.","tags":["Driver Visual Attention Modeling"],"title":"The Multimodal Driver Monitoring Database: A Naturalistic Corpus to Study Driver Attention","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tiancheng Hu","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

Achieving this goal with regular RGB cameras faces challenges in automotive applications due to occlusions, extreme head poses and sudden changes in illumination. Most of these challenges can be attenuated with algorithms relying on depth cameras. This paper proposes a novel point-cloud based deep learning approach to estimate the driver's head pose from depth camera data, addressing these challenges. The proposed algorithm is inspired by the PointNet++ framework, where points are sampled and grouped before extracting discriminative features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm by evaluating our approach on a naturalistic driving database consisting of 22 drivers, where the benchmark for the orientation of the driver's head is obtained with the Fi-Cap device. The experimental evaluation demonstrates that our proposed approach relying on point-cloud data achieves predictions that are almost always more reliable than state-of-the-art head pose estimation methods based on regular cameras. Furthermore, our approach provides predictions even for extreme rotations, which is not the case for the baseline methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to propose head pose estimation using deep learning on point-cloud data.","tags":["Driver Visual Attention Modeling"],"title":"Robust Driver Head Pose Estimation in Naturalistic Conditions from Point-Cloud Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;\rif porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;:\rprint(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)\r  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}}\r{{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}}\r{{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}\r Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}}\r- Only the speaker can read these notes\r- Press `S` key to view\r{{% /speaker_note %}}\r Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}\r{{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}\r{{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}\r  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1,\r.reveal section h2,\r.reveal section h3 {\rcolor: navy;\r}\r  Questions?
